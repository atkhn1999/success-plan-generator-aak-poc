# Success Plan UI â€” Starter

Vite + React + Tailwind starter with a static Success Plan UI. No UI library. Icons via `lucide-react`.

## Quick start
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Build
```bash
npm run build
```

## Deploy on Netlify
- New site from Git -> pick your repo
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist`

## Notes
- This is static. Wire up data, routing, and exports in Cursor.
- The UI is intentionally simple. Replace any `select` or menus with your preferred headless lib if needed.
